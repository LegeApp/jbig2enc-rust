# jbig2enc-rust

A JBIG2 encoder and decoder in Rust for bilevel (black-and-white) images —
scanned documents, PDF-embedded streams, and standalone JBIG2 files.

The crate is split into an `encode` half and a `decode` half over a shared
protocol core. Both halves are independent Cargo features; a consumer can build
either alone. Both halves are production ready.

## Encoder

Three operating points:

- **`generic`** — pages encoded as generic JBIG2 regions, no symbol
  dictionary. Fastest, lossless with respect to the input bitmap, largest
  output of the three.
- **`symbol`** — connected components are extracted, repeated glyphs are
  grouped into a symbol dictionary, and page instances reference dictionary
  entries. Lossy (symbol substitution), much smaller than `generic` on
  text-heavy scans.
- **`sym_unify`** — the symbol pipeline plus a family-unification pass that
  merges symbol variants across pages (scanning noise, border variation,
  page-to-page drift) using exact dictionary-entry byte accounting and
  planner-side anchor remapping. Smallest output; slower than plain `symbol`.

Mode selection is by config preset:

```rust
use jbig2enc_rust::Jbig2Config;

let generic   = Jbig2Config::lossless();
let symbol    = Jbig2Config::text();
let sym_unify = Jbig2Config::text_symbol_unify();
```

### Measurements

In-process 350-page comparison against the original C `jbig2enc` (same
preloaded PBM page set, release builds both sides, page preparation outside
the timed region), corpus `sahib2/350p`:

- `c generic`: 5228.2 KB in 1.15 s
- `rust generic`: 5232.2 KB in 2.47 s
- `c symbol`: 2566.5 KB in 24.58 s
- `rust symbol`: 2227.1 KB in 6.05 s
- `rust sym_unify`: 2025.9 KB in 16.93 s

Relative: Rust `generic` is size-parity with the C encoder; Rust `symbol` is
13.2% smaller and about 4.1× faster than C symbol mode; `sym_unify` is 21.1%
smaller than C symbol mode. Within the Rust encoder, `symbol` is 57.4% smaller
than `generic`, and `sym_unify` is 61.3% smaller than `generic` (9.0% smaller
than `symbol`).

A `confed/10p` release benchmark after the 0.5.3 portable-SIMD comparator
change (`wide`-based `u32x8` kernels in symbol matching, scalar early-exit
preserved):

- `symbol`: 175.3 KB in 0.57 s
- `sym_unify`: 145.0 KB in 2.47 s (17.3% smaller than `symbol`)

Known encoder limits: the symbol modes leave more material in generic residual
regions than an ideal long-book encoder would, and refinement-assisted coding
is not implemented. These are compression-efficiency limits; no substitution
errors have been observed on the development corpora.

## Decoder

A full-featured JBIG2 decoder covering both embedded (PDF `/JBIG2Decode`,
globals stream + page stream) and standalone file organisation:

- Generic regions: arithmetic templates 0–3, TPGDON, and MMR.
- Symbol dictionaries and text regions: arithmetic and Huffman variants,
  including refinement/aggregate coding and custom Huffman tables.
- Refinement regions, pattern dictionaries, and halftone regions.
- Striped pages, intermediate regions, and segment retention handling.
- `DecodeStrictness::Compatible` accepts the spec deviations real-world
  encoders produce and records each recovery as a typed `RecoveryEvent`;
  `Strict` rejects them. Inputs outside the supported surface return typed
  `Unsupported` errors — the decoder does not panic on malformed input.
- `decode_embedded_into` decodes into caller-owned buffers through a pooled
  `DecoderContext` (per-worker context, shared immutable `DecodedGlobals`),
  for zero-allocation steady state in multi-page workloads. Output is packed
  1-bit rows.

Decode benchmarks (release, single thread): A4 generic page ~31 ms (parity
with `jbig2dec` 0.20), symbol page ~4.4 ms, halftone page ~20 ms. `jbig2dec`
is used as the differential oracle in the test suite; some validation tools
expect it in `PATH`.

## Usage

```toml
[dependencies]
jbig2enc-rust = "0.5.3"            # encoder + decoder + symboldict (defaults)
```

Decoder only:

```toml
[dependencies.jbig2enc-rust]
version = "0.5.3"
default-features = false
features = ["decode"]
```

Encoding a single page:

```rust
use jbig2enc_rust::{Jbig2Config, encode_single_image};

let input = vec![0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0];
let (width, height) = (2, 4);
let result = encode_single_image(&input, width, height, false)?;
```

PDF split output (global dictionary and page-local data separated for
embedding):

```rust
use jbig2enc_rust::{Jbig2Context, encode_single_image};

let _ctx = Jbig2Context::with_pdf_mode(true);
let result = encode_single_image(&input, width, height, true)?;
// result.global_data — global dictionary segments, if any
// result.page_data   — page-local segments
```

## Cargo features

- `encode` — the encoder half.
- `decode` — the decoder half. Either half builds without the other.
- `symboldict` — symbol-dictionary encoding (implies `encode`; on by default).
- `parallel` — Rayon-based parallel helpers where available.
- `tracing`, `trace_encoder`, `trace_arith` — logging/tracing hooks.
- `line_verify` — line verification helpers.
- `refine` — refinement-related configuration paths.
- `profiling` — profiling support.
- `halftone_bin` — image support for the halftone tooling binaries.

## Layout

```
src/
  encode/   encoder pipeline: api, cc (connected components), classify,
            comparator, simd, cost, unify planning, halftone, document assembly
  decode/   decoder: segment/page parsing, generic/text/halftone regions,
            symbol dictionaries, huffman, mmr, refinement, arith, context pooling
  shared/   protocol core shared by both halves
```

## Testing

```bash
cargo test                                   # full suite
cargo test --no-default-features --features decode   # decoder half alone
cargo test --test comparator                 # symbol comparator
cargo test --test perf_smoke -- --ignored --nocapture
```

The encoder's byte-identical output guard lives in
`tests/encode_byte_identical.rs` (regenerate hashes with
`UPDATE_ENCODE_HASHES=1`).
